üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üî°Is it possible to use a language's letter frequency to decrypt a cipher? 

This was an early project that I created to force myself to learn text evaluation and shiny app development in R. The original idea was to make a package of functions related to classical cryptography, but this one function so "stuck" me that I ended up focusing solely on it for a while. 

Better versions of this app exist online that will allow you to analyze your text and hard-code letters that you have solved, but this feature is not yet possible in my construction of the app. Additionally, a better app might search for strings such as "the" and use it to auto-decode, but again, this ain't it. 

To give it a while, go to [https://acm9q.shinyapps.io/cryptoapp/](the app) and type in your cyphertext. Don't have any? I recommend the speeches of Barack Obama when cycled through [www.rot13.com](rot13).
